# Concept: Glide Path Allocation

## What is a Glide Path?
A glide path is an investment strategy that adjusts asset allocation over time â€” typically reducing risk as the goal date nears.

## How it Works:
- Start with aggressive growth (more equities)
- Gradually reduce equity exposure in favor of bonds and cash
- Commonly used in retirement and education planning

## Example:
For a retirement goal 30 years away:
- Year 1: 90% equities, 10% bonds
- Year 15: 70% equities, 30% bonds
- Year 30: 50% equities, 40% bonds, 10% cash

## Benefits:
- Reduces risk as capital becomes more critical
- Aligns portfolio with investor's decreasing risk tolerance
